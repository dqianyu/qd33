I'm a foruth year Ph.D student in the [Statistics department](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/statistics/) at UC Santa Cruz, advised by Dr. [Zehang Richard Li](https://zehangli.com/). My current research interest falls in statistical modeling for improving public health. Specifically, I'm interested in Bayesian modeling, survey statistics, small area estimation. My current project involves cross-fitting model evaluation for prevalence estimation from complex survey. 

I got my BS in Mathematics and Business Administration in 2019 from University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I received my MS in Mathematical Statistics in 2022 at Wake Forest University, advised by Dr. [Staci Hepler](https://sites.google.com/a/wfu.edu/hepler/).
